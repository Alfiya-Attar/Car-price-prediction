# Car-price-prediction
## Introduction:
The price of a car depends on a lot of factors like the manufacturer of the car, features of the car, fueltype, gearbox type and the mileage it gives and many more. Car price prediction is one of the major research areas in machine learning.
## Objective:
•	Analyze the cars price data and find insights from it.           

•	Fit machine learning model to predict car price. 
## Dataset Description:
•	The dataset has 19238 entries, over 18 columns. The 18 columns or features are:
## We have performed:
1) EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS
2) VISUALIZATION
3) MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHM
